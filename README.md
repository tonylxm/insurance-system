# Insurance System and Database
Project for SOFTENG 281 (Object-Oriented Programming) in Part II of my Software Engineering degree @The University of Auckland.
I scored 100% for this project (functionality + OO design + codestyle).

### Built With
- Java
- JUnit (for unit testing)

## Project Requirements
- Design an OOP solution to a problem
- Apply OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation (information hiding)
- Stores information about clients and their policies
- Calculates discounts and premiums based on project specifications
- Unit testing with JUnit testing framework to write my own test cases

## Getting Started
Try it out for yourself!
Clone the repository using git and open the project in your preferred Java IDE:
  ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-algorithms.git
  ```

## Personal Learnings
- Improved my Java programming skills
- Enhanced understanding and utilisation of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- Developed proficiency in designing object-oriented solutions

## Future Improvements
- Creation of an aesthetic GUI for a better user experience
- Incorporation of additional features to enhance the functionality and usability of the insurance system
- For larger scale applications, integration of a backend database like MongoDB for storing and retrieving client and policy information would be beneficial
